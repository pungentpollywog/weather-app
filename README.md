# Frontend Mentor - Weather app

![Design preview for the Weather app coding challenge](./preview.jpg)

## Welcome! 👋

Thanks for checking out this coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

**To do this challenge, you need a good understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.**

## The challenge

Build a weather app using the [Open-Meteo API](https://open-meteo.com/) or [National Weather Service API](https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api) and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- Search for weather information by entering a location in the search bar
- View current weather conditions including temperature, weather icon, and location details
- See additional weather metrics like "feels like" temperature, humidity percentage, wind speed, and precipitation amounts
- Browse a 7-day weather forecast with daily high/low temperatures and weather icons
- View an hourly forecast showing temperature changes throughout the day
- Switch between different days of the week using the day selector in the hourly forecast section
- Toggle between Imperial and Metric measurement units via the units dropdown
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## Getting started

### What's included

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design.

**In your download:**
- Mobile and desktop designs (JPG format)
- All required assets in the `/assets` folder
- Variable and static font files (or link to Google Fonts)
- `style-guide.md` with colors, fonts, and other design specs

**Want more accurate builds?** The designs are in JPG static format, which means you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding`, and `margin`. If you'd like the Figma design file to help build a more accurate solution faster, you can [subscribe as a PRO member](https://www.frontendmentor.io/pro).

### API setup

This project uses the [Open-Meteo API](https://open-meteo.com/) to fetch weather data.

As an alternative, you could also use the [National Weather Service](https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api).

**Good news:** Open-Meteo is completely free and doesn't require an API key! You can start making requests right away.

- **API Documentation:** [https://open-meteo.com/en/docs](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs)
- **No rate limits** for reasonable personal use
- Example endpoint: `https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast?latitude=52.52&longitude=13.41&current_weather=true`

Check their documentation for all available weather parameters and location search capabilities.
